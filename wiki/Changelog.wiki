=Alpha A released=

Alpha A of slum is released. Currently its called slumMaya because it only have one client: Maya. This is the first alpha release. Very buggy and incomplete, but working. It fully works in maya 2008. Not tested in 8.5 (although it should work. feedbacks are welcome) At the moment, slum comes just with 2 slum templates:

# testUI.slum - an shader just to test clients UI 
# occlusion.slum - an occlusion shader (currently it only supports 3delight renderer)

please play with it and let me know how it goes.

before someone asks, a thumbnail render preview for the shader UI is on the way! 8P
