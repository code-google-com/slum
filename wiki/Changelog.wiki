==Alpha A released==

[http://slum.googlecode.com/files/slumMaya.zip slum alpha-A download]

Alpha A of slum is available in the Downloads section or the link above. Currently its called slumMaya.zip because slum only have the maya client at the moment. This is the first alpha release. Very buggy and incomplete, but working. It fully works in maya 2008. Not tested in 8.5 (although it should work. feedbacks are welcome) At the moment, slum comes just with 2 slum templates:

  # testUI.slum - an shader just to test clients UI 
  # occlusion.slum - an occlusion shader (currently it only supports 3delight renderer)

please play with it and let me know how it goes.

before someone asks, a thumbnail render preview for the shader UI is on the way! 8P
