# SLUM - Shader Language Unified Manager #

> SLUM is a central hub for development of render shaders for computer graphics.

> Basically, SLUM gives you the capability of design one shader that contains language components for more than one render software, like GLSL, Renderman, 3Delight, Air, etc.

> I invite everybody to download slum and give it a try! Any feedback, suggestions, feature requests and issue reports is really welcome!
